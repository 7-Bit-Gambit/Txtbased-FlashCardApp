In check level
  is digit will trow an error if a card has a negative level ie. (-1)
    Do we allow negatives? - Decision Required
    Error handling required:
        try:
        except

in learning
  We should clearly state that only the "answered" cards are updated
    Like
        “Session terminated. Progress on answered cards has been saved; untouched cards are unchanged.”

Overal
  Deck listing can be functionalized?
  Should we work with numbered lists for deck selection?
    Improves UX
      Idea:
        enumerate decks
          select deck by number not by name

To be implemented:
  must:
  Randomize questions

  nice to have:
  Deck editor
  don't ask cards with a high level
